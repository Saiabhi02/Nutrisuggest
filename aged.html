<h3>What's in a Good Diet</h3>
<p>Usually, you get the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients you need with a well-balanced diet, but many older adults donâ€™t. Here are some areas that often fall short.</p>
<p><b>B vitamins.</b> Keep a close eye on vitamins B6, B12, and folate, also called folic acid. You can often get all three in cereals with added vitamins. You also get:</p>
<li>B6 in whole grains and organ meats, like liver</li>
<li>B12 in lean meats and some fish</li>
<li>Folate from dark greens, beans, and peas</li>
<p><b>Calcium and vitamin D:</b> These are important for strong bones. Calcium is in dairy products, like milk and yogurt, and in dark, green, leafy vegetables, like broccoli and kale. You get vitamin D from being out in the sun. That can be harder for someone who's unwell, so look for products with added vitamin D.</p>
<p><b>Fiber:</b> Fiber is good for the heart, helps prevent diabetes, and keeps you regular to avoid constipation. Good sources include beans, whole grains, and veggies.</p>
<p><b>Healthy fats:</b> Try to limit fat (especially saturated) and cholesterol, and totally avoid trans fats. They can lead to heart and blood pressure problems. </p>
<p><b>Potassium:</b> Not eating enough potassium can raise blood pressure. You get potassium in foods such as bananas, potatoes, and yogurt.</p>
<h3>Serving sizes and amounts:</h3>
<p>When it comes to meals, it's good to know serving sizes and how much you need for your age. For the five food groups, aim for these serves each day :</p>
<p>Serving sizes for each food group are: </p>
<li><b>vegetables:</b> a standard serve is about 75 grams (100-350 kilojoules); for example, 1/2 cup cooked green or orange vegetables or 1/2 cup cooked dried or canned beans, peas or lentils</li>
<li><b>Fruit:</b> a standard serve is 150 grams (350 kilojoules); for example, a medium apple or banana, or two kiwifruits or plums. Try to eat whole fruit and not fruit juice
grain foods: a standard serve is 500 kilojoules; for example, one slice of bread or 1/2 cup cooked porridge. At least two-thirds of choices should be wholegrain varieties</li>
<li><b>Lean meats and poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds, and legumes/beans:</b> a standard serve is 500-600 kilojoules; for example, 65 grams cooked lean red meats or two large eggs</li>
<li><b>Milk, yoghurt and cheese or alternatives:</b> a standard serve is 500-600 kilojoules; for example, a cup of milk or 3/4 cup yoghurt.</li>
